# 📈 Demand Planning & Forecasting – Case Study

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Demand Planning and Forecasting** using historical sales data.  
The analysis focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Trend Analysis, and Regression Modeling** to forecast traffic and GMV (Gross Merchandise Value).  

The goal is to build a structured forecasting framework that improves **accuracy, demand visibility, and planning efficiency**.

## 🔑 Key Steps
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Collected historical demand and sales data.
   - Cleaned missing and inconsistent entries.
   - Structured dataset for regression-based forecasting.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identified seasonal and monthly demand variations.
   - Plotted trends in traffic and GMV.
   - Detected outliers affecting forecasting accuracy.

3. **Trend Analysis**
   - Applied trendline fitting to visualize long-term demand.
   - Used regression models to capture demand shifts.

4. **Forecasting Models**
   - **Traffic Forecasting** → Built regression model to predict future website/app traffic.  
   - **GMV Forecasting** → Applied multi-linear regression to estimate Gross Merchandise Value.
